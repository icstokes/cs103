        <h3>Location & Weather</h3>
        <p>Florence is located inland in the Tuscany region of Italy. Fun fact: in Italy, Florence is more often
            called Firenze!</p>
        <p>Florence is surrounded by hills and mountains, and the Arno River runs through the city, creating
            beautiful panoramic views.<br>
            I visited Florence in the spring of 2022, and I believe that April is definitely the best month to go.
            The weather was absolutely perfect, with temperatures in the 70s (Fahrenheit) and clear skies every day!
        </p>
        <h3>Packing list</h3>
        <p>I recommend packing these things if you are visiting Florence, but always check the weather beforehand
            and pack accordingly!</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Several T-shirts</li>
            <li>A few pairs of cropped pants</li>
            <li>A light jacket and/or sweater (for cooler nights)</li>
            <li>A collared shirt or a blouse (for museums and restaurants)</li>
            <li>A nice pair of slacks or a dress (see above)</li>
            <li>Comfortable shoes (you will be doing a LOT of walking)</li>
            <li>Sunglasses and/or a hat</li>
            <li>Sunscreen!</li>
            <li>A raincoat and umbrella (it didn't rain when I was there, but it's always a possibility!)</li>
            <li>A small but secure bag for your belongings (I recommend a <a
                    href="https://pacsafe.com/?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwh4-wBhB3EiwAeJsppFuskTbG216bnS98B9PU0PrhVV1iLcM1QdxBfuGVpOq1_ZR2TWjHUBoCMFwQAvD_BwE">PacSafe
                crossbody or sling</a>)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Don't forget your passport and other essential documents!</p>
        <h3>Landmarks & Attractions</h3>
        <p>Florence has a rich history and is home to dozens of museums and galleries. Even if you stay for several
            days, you won't be able to do and see everything. Fortunately, I've prepared a short list of some of
            Florence's more famous landmarks for you to visit!</p>
        <h4>Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore</h4>
        <p>The Florence Cathedral, also known as the Duomo, is famous for its iconic red dome, engineered by Filippo
            Brunelleschi in the 1400s.<br>
            The cathedral is now a museum, and houses many frescos and works of art. Guests are also able to
            appreciate the engineering and design of the cathedral itself.<br>
            Check <a href="https://duomo.firenze.it/en/home">the cathedral's website</a> for museum hours and ticket
            availability.</p>
        <h4>The Uffizi Gallery</h4>
        <p>The Uffizi is home to dozens of famous paintings by artists such as Caravaggio, Botticelli, and
            Michelangelo, as well as other European artists.<br>
            The gallery also contains sculptures from the Medici family collection, as well as Roman copies of
            ancient Greek statues.<br>
            I must warn you: the Uffizi is <em>big</em>. It's definitely something you'll want to dedicate an entire
            day to.<br>
            Go to <a href="https://www.uffizi.it/en/the-uffizi">the official Uffizi Gallery website</a> to check
            ticket prices and choose an entry timeslot.</p>
        <h4>La Galleria Dell'Accademia di Firenze</h4>
        <p>The Accademia Gallery in Florence holds paintings from the era of the Italian Renaissance as well as many
            sculptures, the most famous being Michelangelo's <em>David</em>.<br>
            I unfortunately did not have the chance to see it when I went to Florence, so I can only imagine how
            amazing it must look up close. <br>
            <a href="https://www.galleriaaccademiafirenze.it/en/">The Accademia's website</a> contains information
            about its various exhibits, as well as how to purchase tickets.</p>
        <p>There are so many other places to visit in Florence (such as the Ponte Vecchio, a famous bridge that
            crosses the river.) The ones I have listed here barely scratch the surface of things to do!<br>
            I recommend doing more research and planning out your trip as much as you can, to make the most of your
            time in Florence!</p>
        <h3>Food and Hotels</h3>
        <p>Florence has amazing restaurants and quality hotels that will elevate your trip! For hotels, I recommend the
            <a href="https://www.hotelspadai.it/">Hotel Spadai</a>. It is centrally located and just a short walk from
            some of the attractions I listed above!
            <br> If you're looking for something a bit more scenic, the <a
                    href="https://www.fhhotelgroup.it/en/grand-hotel-mediterraneo-firenze/index">Gran Mediterrano</a>
            offers beautiful views of the Arno, while still being relatively close to the center of Florence.</p>
        <p>Florence, like many other places in Italy, has top-notch cuisine. As there are dozens of places to choose
            from, all with diverse food options, I recommend searching <a
                    href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurants-g187895-Florence_Tuscany.html">TripAdvisor</a> (a list
            of Florentine restaurants is linked) or another website to find the place that sounds the best to you.</p>
