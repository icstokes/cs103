<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I am from Poolesville, Maryland (about an hour outside of Washington, DC.)<br> I have a younger brother who is a junior in high school right now.<br> I am currently an English major here at BU, because my goal for the future is to become a published author.<br> I enjoy reading, watching movies, and playing videogames in my free time.<br> I participated in BU On Broadway last semester, helping with the lighting for the musical we put on, and I hope to do so again this semester.</p>
